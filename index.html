          <p>It was the time that I was able to acknowledge the importance of overcoming my limits.
            Approximately, we rode 320 km within 3 days and had a chance to encounter certain dangers
            such as being isolated in the mountains when the light was fading under the darkness.
            Likewise, a threat from the wild animals had frightened us in the darkness as well. However, I still remember the emotion
            when I smelled a breeze of sea coming through my nose which had a victorious signification that it is over!
            It was the moment and memory that I would never exchange with something else but I will always cherish all the memories
            I have made. Furthermore, I would like to thank
            my bros who had a chance to share such a great moment of accomplishment with me.</p>

          <p>I started to feel that I wanted to experience more adventures after the bike trip with my bros.
            So, I have begun to challenge myself by climbing the tallest mountain in Kansai and in Shiga.
            The way to the top of the mountain was tough and it required a lot of stamina and endurance.
            However, once I reached to the top, I was able to forget all of my pain and it was the time that
            I could feel my effort and motivation. "I will never give up".</p>

          <p>It was my first time travelling other country that I have never visited before with my own money and I was gladly proud of myself. Me and my colleagues had so much fun in Vietnam that we could not
            albe to sleep without wine or beer. Moreover, everything was perfect in terms of food, atmosphere, and even the lifestyle of Vietnamese people.
            Especially, the environment of nature in Vietnam was magnificent that I was continually lured by it during the trip.
            The photo in front of the waterfall was taken in order to demonstrate how it has been well preserved and how much I love feeing the nature.
            It was the best moment in my life travelling with someone that I can rely on and someone that I can gladly call them <strong>'bro'</strong>. </p>
